# Computational-Physics-and-AI-Architecture
## 🎙️ 1. Project Amadeus: Voice-Interactive Conversational AI
* **Objective:** Engineering a real-time, multimodal AI assistant to explore human-computer interaction and dynamic natural language processing.
* **Implementation:** * Architected an independent, Python-based conversational agent by integrating the **Gemini API** with **macOS native speech recognition libraries**.
  * Successfully managed real-time audio data pipelines, API request/response latency, and context-aware natural language generation to create a seamless, hands-free voice interaction loop.
  * **Skills Demonstrated:** API Integration, Audio Stream Processing, Asynchronous Programming, and Multimodal AI Engineering.

## 🧠 2. Deep Learning & Pattern Recognition Architectures
* **Objective:** Developing a robust computational foundation for processing complex, multi-dimensional physical data.
* **Implementation:** * Architected and trained **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)** from scratch to achieve high-accuracy handwritten digit classification (MNIST).
  * Leveraged **Python, TensorFlow, and Keras** to manipulate tensor structures, optimize loss functions via backpropagation, and establish a foundational framework directly applicable to future experimental physics data analysis.

## 🤖 3. Autonomous Archive Management via Local LLM
* **Objective:** Streamlining the organization, categorization, and version control of my graduate-level theoretical physics manuscripts.
* **Implementation:** * Engineered a custom automation pipeline driven by a **local LLM (Ollama)**.
  * The Python script autonomously monitors local directory modifications, applies natural language processing to categorize complex physics notes, and executes automated Git commits/pushes to my public repositories.
  * **Skills Demonstrated:** Local LLM Deployment, Prompt Engineering, Regex/File System Automation, and Git CI/CD Workflow.

## 🌪️ 4. Thermodynamics & Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
* **Thermodynamic Simulations (SimScale):** * Conducted advanced thermal simulations and heat flux modeling. 
  * *Note: Due to platform sharing restrictions, complete simulation reports, solution fields, and boundary condition data are archived in this repository as `SimScale_Thermal_Results.zip`.*
* **Ongoing Work - Navier-Stokes Implementation:** * Currently expanding my computational toolkit by independently programming the *12 Steps to Navier-Stokes* framework in Python, bridging the gap between theoretical fluid dynamics and finite-difference numerical methods.
